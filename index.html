	<p>Qurʾān, (Arabic: “Recitation”) also spelled Quran and Koran, the sacred scripture of Islam. According to conventional Islamic belief, the Qurʾān was revealed by the angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad in the West Arabian towns Mecca and Medina beginning in 610 and ending with Muhammad’s death in 632 CE. The word qurʾān, which occurs already within the Islamic scripture itself (e.g., 9:111 and 75:17–18), is derived from the verb qaraʾa—“to read,” “to recite”—but there is probably also some connection with the Syriac qeryānā, “reading,” used for the recitation of scriptural readings during church services. The Qurʾānic corpus, composed in an early form of Classical Arabic, is traditionally believed to be a literal transcript of God’s speech and to constitute the earthly reproduction of an uncreated and eternal heavenly original, according to the general view referred to in the Qurʾān itself as “the well-preserved tablet” (al-lawḥ al-mahfūẓ; Qurʾān 85:22).</p><a href="quran.html">CLICK ME FOR QURAN</a>

<h2>Form and content</h2>
<p>Qurʾān
Qurʾān
The Qurʾān is markedly shorter than even the New Testament, let alone the Hebrew Bible. It is subdivided into 114 chapterlike units called “sūrahs,” a word used within the Qurʾān to designate revelatory passages of an unspecific length (e.g., 9:64). With the exception of the short opening sūrah, recited during each of the five daily Islamic prayers, the sūrahs are ordered roughly according to decreasing length, although this general rule is frequently interrupted. The second sūrah is by far the longest one. All sūrahs are traditionally known by names—many of them by more than one—which appear to have emerged only after the death of the Prophet. Sūrah names are usually derived from some conspicuous word in the respective text, such as “The Cow” (the second) or “The Poets” (the 26th), though they do not necessarily identify a text’s main theme. Each sūrah, apart from the ninth, is preceded by the so-called basmalah, the formulaic invocation “In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.” Many sūrahs (e.g., the second) are opened by detached Arabic letters, the meaning of which has not yet been satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p>Internally, the sūrahs are subdivided into verses called āyāt (singular āyah), a word that literally means “sign” and is also used in the Qurʾān to designate manifestations of God’s power and grace, such as miscellaneous aspects of the natural world (e.g., God’s sending down of rain) or the punishments that God is said to have inflicted on sinful peoples of the past. Qurʾānic verse borders are normally defined by the presence of a verse-final rhyme, even though the Islamic tradition transmits conflicting systems of subdividing the Qurʾān into individual verses. The subdivision that is now predominant counts a total of 6,236 verses. These display extreme divergences in length, ranging from only a few words to entire paragraphs of text, but it should be noted that verse length across a given sūrah is tangibly more uniform than across the entire corpus. Unlike classical Arabic poetry, whose beginnings stretch back to pre-Islamic times, Qurʾānic verses do not adhere to a quantitative metre; i.e., they do not conform to fixed patterns of long and short syllables. In this sense, it is correct to insist, with the Islamic tradition, on a principled distinction between Qurʾānic and poetic verses. Many parts of the Qurʾān are highly formulaic, and longer verses often conclude with certain set phrases, such as “God is forgiving, compassionate” or “God is knowing, wise.”</p>

<p>The Qurʾān generally styles itself as divine speech by employing the first person singular or plural (“I” or “we”) in statements that clearly refer to the Deity. However, this divine voice alternates with third-person statements about God. Utterances by Muhammad are normally introduced by the command “Say:…,” thus emphasizing that the Prophet is speaking on divine injunction only. Prophetic statements often respond to objections or denials ascribed to Muhammad’s opponents, which cast doubt on Qurʾānic doctrines such as the belief in a universal resurrection of the dead or in the existence of only one God. This can result in an extended to-and-fro that endows parts of the Qurʾān with a decidedly polemical and disputatious quality.</p>


<h3>Islam</h3>
<p>Many passages of the Qurʾān are devoted to describing the eschatological judgment through which God will consign each human being to paradise or hell and portraying the ensuing rewards of the saved and torments of the damned. There are also narratives, some of which centre on biblical persons, such as Adam, Moses, Jesus, and Mary. Narrative passages include brief reminiscences (e.g., 85:17–18) as well as much more extensive accounts (e.g., the 12th sūrah, devoted to the story of Joseph). Regardless of their length, these stories are generally retold in an allusive style that would appear to presuppose that they were already known to their target audience. The stress is not on details of the narrative plots but on their didactic significance, which is often explicitly pointed out by means of interjected comments. In many cases, Qurʾānic narratives show important parallels not merely to certain biblical passages but also to postbiblical Rabbinic and Christian texts. For example, the story of Abraham’s dispute with his idolatrous father and his destruction of his people’s false deities (e.g., 37:83–98) is not found in the book of Genesis itself but only in later texts, such as a Rabbinic commentary on Genesis. The mediation of those narrative traditions into the Qurʾān’s environment may very well have relied on oral transmission rather than written texts. Even where the Qurʾān retells previously attested stories, it normally does so by harnessing them to its own theological agenda. The Qurʾān’s demonstrable overlap with earlier traditions is patently in line with its self-description as providing a “confirmation” of previous revelations (e.g., 2:97).</p>

<p>Except for the shortest sūrahs that are positioned toward the end of the Qurʾānic corpus, almost all others consist of a succession of paragraph-like sections between which there are frequent and often seemingly abrupt topic shifts. At first sight, the literary coherence of many sūrahs may therefore appear doubtful. Nonetheless, research conducted since the 1980s has increasingly demonstrated that the sūrahs do in fact display a high degree of compositional unity that is manifested, for instance, in the recurrence of key terms and phrases, sometimes in such a way as to create conspicuous terminological brackets or to yield concentric literary structures. Furthermore, many medium-sized sūrahs conform to a common structural template that centres on a narrative middle section. Particularly accessible examples are sūrahs 26, 37, and 54, whose middle section consists of a cycle of stories recounting how God dispatched earlier messengers to admonish their compatriots. These warners include not only biblical figures such as Noah, Abraham, and Moses but also nonbiblical messengers sent to certain ancient Arabian tribes. In almost all cases, God’s emissaries are dismissed or ignored, resulting in a catastrophic divine punishment. Apart from such obvious parallels in content, most of the individual episodes constituting these narrative cycles are also concluded by a refrain, adding further symmetry to the entire composition.</p>

<p>The Qurʾān forms the bedrock of Islamic law, even though many legal details are derived not from scripture but from extra-Qurʾānic utterances and actions attributed to Muhammad—the so-called Ḥadīth. Most of the Qurʾān’s legal or quasi-legal pronouncements are concentrated in a few of the longest sūrahs, the most extensive block of such material being 2:153–283. The domains covered by Qurʾānic law include matters of family law (e.g., inheritance rules), ritual law (e.g., the performance of ablution before prayer or the duty to fast during the month of Ramadan), dietary regulations (e.g., the prohibition of consuming pork or wine), criminal law (e.g., the punishment for theft or for manslaughter), and commercial law (the prohibition of usury). Concrete behavioral prescriptions are not expounded in a systematic order and can be presented as responses to audience queries—for instance, at 5:4, “They ask you what is permitted to them [to eat]. Say:….”</p>

<h4>Origin and compilation</h4>

Quʾrān manuscript
Whether or not the Qurʾān was divinely revealed is a question of religious belief that is not amenable to historical or philological confirmation or falsification. What does admit of scholarly scrutiny, however, is the text’s likely appearance in place and time. Islamic sources report that a complete written collection of the Qurʾānic revelations was produced only after the Prophet’s death, when a great number of those who knew the Qurʾān by heart were killed on the battlefield and the fear arose that knowledge of the Qurʾān might disappear. It was accordingly decided to collect the Qurʾānic revelations. These are said to have been recorded on materials as diverse as palm branches and stones as well as having been preserved in people’s memories. A companion of the Prophet, Zayd ibn Thābit, reportedly copied out on sheets of parchment whatever proclamations he could find and handed them over to the second caliph (leader of the Islamic community), ʿUmar (reigned 634–644 CE). After ʿUmar’s death the collection was inherited by his daughter Ḥafṣah. In order to forestall divergences in the recitation of the Qurʾān, the third caliph, ʿUthmān (reigned 644–656 CE), is reported to have ordered that copies of Zayd ibn Thābit’s recension be sent to the main garrison towns of the Islamic realm and that alternative versions of scripture be burned.</p>

<p>It bears emphasizing that ʿUthmān’s standardization is understood to have pertained only to the Qurʾān’s so-called rasm, its consonantal skeleton shorn of any auxiliary signs. Apart from lacking vowels, the rasm also includes a significant number of consonantal homographs. Incidentally, medieval Islamic scholarship readily acknowledges the resulting ambiguity by admitting more than one authoritative way of reading many Qurʾānic words as long as these readings are considered to have been transmitted from early authorities.</p>

<p>Although some scholars have conjectured that the final standardization of the Qurʾānic rasm might not have taken place until considerably later than is maintained by the Islamic tradition, the carbon dating of a number of early Qurʾānic manuscripts has produced results that are by and large consistent with the traditional view that the received text of the Qurʾān was in existence by about 650 CE. Other considerations—for instance, the fact that the Qurʾān is lacking in unequivocal references to any of the main events of Islamic history after the death of the Prophet—also support the assumption that the Qurʾānic corpus is to be dated to the first decades of the 7th century and really does comprise the prophetic proclamations of Muhammad (whose historical existence is confirmed by early non-Islamic sources). Nonetheless, on purely historical grounds, it is difficult to rule out that the Qurʾān could have undergone some amount of early post-prophetic editing, a possibility that remains to be assessed by future research.</p>

<p>According to Islamic tradition, the Qurʾān was revealed to Muhammad in separate passages that often consisted of isolated verses or verse groups. Islamic sources preserve a great number of reports about the occasions on which a certain sūrah or part of a sūrah was allegedly revealed. Thus, pre-modern Muslim exegetes envisaged the revelation of the Qurʾān as having been intimately connected with specific events in the life of the Prophet that are reported by extra-Qurʾānic literature. However, Western scholarship has gradually adopted a more cautious attitude toward the reliability of the relevant extra-scriptural material, which often cannot be traced back further than the 8th or at most the late 7th century CE. Recent research therefore exhibits a pronounced tendency to examine the Qurʾān’s theological and literary features in deliberate isolation from later accounts about the life of Muhammad. At the same time, current scholarship is marked by a renewed awareness of the very significant degree to which the Qurʾānic proclamations are in conversation with a rich array of postbiblical Jewish and Christian traditions that are preserved in non-Arabic (e.g., Hebrew, Greek, or Aramaic) sources. It is important to emphasize that acknowledging such continuity does not entail reducing the Qurʾān to a mere replica of earlier stories and ideas. Instead, the acknowledgement is a precondition of fully appreciating the theological and literary innovativeness that can often be shown to characterize the Qurʾānic appropriation, recasting, and critique of prior traditions.</p>

<p>Working backward from the Qurʾān as a closed corpus that likely came into existence during the prophetic career of Muhammad, is it possible to discriminate between earlier and later layers of the Islamic scripture and to date the sūrahs, or parts thereof, relative to one another? The Islamic tradition distinguishes between Meccan and Medinan revelations, the watershed between the two being Muhammad’s emigration from his hometown of Mecca to Medina in 622. Relying on this traditional bifurcation, the German Orientalist scholars Gustav Weil (died 1889) and Theodor Nöldeke (died 1930) proposed that the Meccan texts could be further subdivided into three successive periods. The primary dating criterion they employed was verse length, with the operative assumption being that Qurʾānic verses tended to grow longer over time. It is of course by no means self-evident that it must be possible to rearrange the material collected in the Qurʾānic corpus into a linear series of temporally consecutive texts, but no alternative account of the Qurʾān’s composition has yet been worked out to a sufficient level of detail and explanatory power. If Weil and Nöldeke’s assumption of a gradual lengthening of verses over time is accepted, then most of the short sūrahs, which also tend to have short verses, emerge as belonging to the early period of Muhammad’s ministry, whereas sūrahs 2–5, for example, would date to a much later stage of the Qurʾān’s emergence. Such a chronology has important implications for understanding the development of Muhammad’s preaching. For instance, one consequence would be that the Qurʾānic proclamations did not begin to show a discernible interest in legal regulations until fairly late.</p>

<h5>Basic ideas</h5>
<p>Many early sūrahs are devoted to the notion of a universal resurrection and “Day of Judgment” (yawm al-dīn). A number of passages at least clearly imply that the judgment will occur very soon (e.g., 70:6–7), although others are more noncommittal (e.g., 72:25). The judgment will be preceded by a thorough disintegration of the cosmos, as depicted, for instance, in Qurʾān 81:1–14. It is frequently emphasized that God’s verdict will be based exclusively on individual merit and demerit and that the Day of Judgment will be “a day at which no soul will be able to do anything for another soul” (82:19). Disbelief in the judgment is assumed to be concomitant with a propensity to exploit and mistreat the weaker members of society, such as orphans and the poor, whose protection the Qurʾān urges (e.g., 107:1–3).</p>

<p>The announcement of an eschatological resurrection of the dead seems to have occasioned doubts and objections among the Qurʾān’s original audience. Many Qurʾānic passages therefore rehearse various aspects of the natural order that God has created, thereby demonstrating his grace toward humankind and his power to recreate all deceased humans at the end of the world (e.g., 75:37–40 or 78:6–16). God’s ability and willingness to enact just punishment is also supported by accounts of his destruction of past peoples (e.g., 89:6–14). At the same time, the Qurʾān assures believers of God’s steadfast assistance to the pious and their entitlement to paradisiacal reward. Narratives about past messengers, such as Noah, Abraham, and Moses, not only illustrate the obliteration of the wicked and impious but also demonstrate that God does not abandon his “chosen servants” in the face of adversity (e.g., 37:74, 81, 111). Thus, the Qurʾānic understanding of God combines the attributes of omnipotence and punitive justice, requiring a human attitude of fearful wariness (taqwā), with an emphasis on God’s creative solicitude for humankind, his compassion, his forgiveness, and his loving affection for the pious (e.g., 7:151–154, 19:96, or 85:14).</p>

<p>A second core doctrine of the Qurʾān, which makes a slightly later appearance than the notion of eschatological judgment, is the denial that there are any other divine beings apart from the one divine creator and judge, Allāh (“the Deity” in Qurʾānic Arabic; e.g., 51:51 and 73:9). By contrast, Muhammad’s opponents are cited as professing additional belief in a plurality of “gods” (e.g., 25:42), who appear to occupy a subordinate and intermediate status and to function as intercessors, obviating exclusive reliance on Allāh. Like the Qurʾānic announcement of an eschatological resurrection, the clash between its uncompromising monotheism, on the one hand, and the willingness of many of its addressees to countenance a more extended pantheon, on the other, triggers polemical exchanges in which Muhammad’s opponents are charged with the sin of “associationism”—i.e., of illicitly relying on other beings and associating them with God.</p>

<p>The sūrahs that are customarily dated to Muhammad’s Medinan period exhibit not only changes in literary format but also new doctrinal developments. Most conspicuous is a novel focus on detailed legal regulations (briefly discussed above) and the expectation that believers are sufficiently committed to engage in militant “striving” on behalf of God (an expectation also espoused by strands of late antique Christianity). The enemies to be striven against are mostly the “unbelievers” and “associators” against whom the earlier Meccan sūrahs polemicize so extensively and who are now accused of having expelled Muhammad and his adherents from their midst and of denying them access to “the inviolable place of prostration,” generally identified with the Meccan Kaʿbah sanctuary (e.g., 2:191, 8:30–34). The presentation of Muhammad also undergoes some noticeable changes across the Qurʾān. Whereas early proclamations describe him primarily as a “warner” whom God has sent to admonish his compatriots (e.g., 32:3) and who has no responsibility beyond the “clear delivery” of God’s message (e.g., 11:57), Medinan sūrahs command believers to obey Muhammad and charge him with passing judgment among them (e.g., 4:59–70). One passage even declares Muhammad to be an “exemplar” for the believers (33:21). Thus, the central importance that imitation of the Prophet plays in traditional Islamic piety has its point of origin already in the Qurʾān. A third distinctive trait of the Medinan sūrahs is an explicit critique of Jewish and Christian beliefs and practices. For instance, Christianity’s signature belief in the divinity of Jesus as the son of God is singled out as an egregious case of associationism (e.g., 5:17, 72–77, 116–118).</p>
